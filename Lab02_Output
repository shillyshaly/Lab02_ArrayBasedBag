RUNNING TEST CASES FOR METHODS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SetInterface plus displaySet
Created set4:
The set capacity is 3; it contains 3 string(s): C A X 
Created set5:
After removing the last element X from set4, it contains:
The set capacity is 3; it contains 2 string(s): C A 

***Testing equals method***
Are set4 and set5 equal? --> YES
Are set5 and set4 equal? --> YES
set5:
The set capacity is 3; it contains 3 string(s): A C X 
Are set4 and set5 equal? --> YES
Removed X from set5:
The set capacity is 3; it contains 2 string(s): A C 
Are set4 and set5 equal now? --> NO
Created setCopyOfSet4:
The set capacity is 2; it contains 2 string(s): C A 
Are set4 and setCopyOfSet4 equal? --> YES

***Testing union, intersection, difference, removeMax, getAllLessThan and isSubset methods***
set4:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 3 string(s): C A X 
set5:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 4 string(s): A B C D 

***Testing union method***
The union of set4 and set5 is:
The set capacity is 12; it contains 5 string(s): C A X B D 

***Testing removeMax method***
Removed the largest element "D" from the union set; the current content is:
The set capacity is 12; it contains 4 string(s): C A X B 
The set is empty and removeMax returned null - CORRECT

***Testing intersection method***
The intersection of set4 and set5 is:
The set capacity is 3; it contains 2 string(s): C A

Is set6 a subset of set7 ? --> YES

***Testing replace method***
set4:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 5 string(s): X A B D C 
Trying to replace the last element with "C"
CORRECT - returned null since no replacement was made
Now set4 contains:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 5 string(s): X A B D C 
Trying to replace the last element with "X"
CORRECT - returned null since no replacement was made
Now set4 contains:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 5 string(s): X A B D C 
Trying to replace the last element with "Z"
CORRECT - replacement was made
Now set4 contains:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 5 string(s): X A B D Z 

Calling replace on emptySet
The set is empty and replace returned null - CORRECT
Now emptySet contains:

***Testing removeAllLarger method***

After removing all that are larger than "Z" set4 contains:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 5 string(s): X A B D Z 
Removing all that are larger than "D"
After removing all that are larger than "D" set4 contains:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 3 string(s): D A B 
Removing all that are larger than "B"
After removing all that are larger than "B" set4 contains:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 2 string(s): B A

set4 contains now:
adding "A" to set4
The set capacity is 6; it contains 1 string(s): A 
Trying 1-element set
set4 contains now:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 1 string(s): A 
adding "B" to set4
The set capacity is 6; it contains 2 string(s): A B 
Trying 2-element set
set4 contains now:
The set capacity is 6; it contains 2 string(s): B A
